    <h1>TRUSS</h1>
    <h2>Introduction to Truss</h2>

    <ul>
        <li> A truss is a structural framework made up of straight members, typically arranged in triangular patterns,
            designed to support loads while distributing them evenly across its various components. </li>
        <li>Trusses are commonly used in construction to provide support for roofs, bridges, towers, and other
            structures</li>
        <li>The triangular arrangement of members in a truss helps to efficiently transfer forces through tension and
            compression, resulting in a lightweight yet sturdy structure</li>
        <li>Trusses are often constructed from materials such as wood, steel, or aluminum, and their design can vary
            depending on the specific requirements of the project.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Why should we study truss ?

    </h3>
   
    <P>Studying trusses is crucial due to their pervasive presence and critical role in numerous real-world
        applications. Trusses are integral components in the construction of bridges, supporting immense loads while
        spanning great distances. For example, the Warren truss design is frequently utilized in bridge construction due
        to its strength and versatility. In roofing systems, trusses provide structural support, allowing for large open
        spaces without the need for interior columns. This is particularly evident in arenas, warehouses, and exhibition
        halls where clear spans are essential for functionality and aesthetics. Moreover, the use of trusses extends to
        telecommunications towers, where their lightweight yet robust design enables the installation of antennas and
        equipment at significant heights. Even in everyday structures like residential buildings, trusses play a vital
        role, distributing loads efficiently to ensure the stability and safety of the roof. By studying trusses,
        engineers gain insights into optimizing designs for various applications, reducing material usage, and enhancing
        structural integrity, ultimately contributing to the advancement of infrastructure worldwide.

    <h3>Two Force Members</h3>
    <p>Before we discuss the structure of trusses, we must begin with defining two force members:<br>
        A two force member is a body that has forces (and only forces, no moments) acting on it in only two locations.
        In order to have a two force member in static equilibrium, the net force at each location must be equal,
        opposite, and collinear. This will result in all two force members being in either tension or compression as
        shown in the diagram
    </p>
    <img src="./two force mem.png" alt="Two force member image" />
    <h3>How to calculate force ?</h3>
    <p>To determine these unknowns, we have two methods available: the method of joints, and the method of sections.
        Both will give the same results, but each through a different process.
    </p>
    <h3>Method of Joints</h3>
    <P>The method of joints focuses on the joints, or the connection points where the members come together. We assume
        we have a pin at each of these points that we model as a particle, we draw out the free body diagram for each
        pin, and then write out the equilibrium equations for each pin. This will result in a large number of
        equilibrium equations that we can use to solve for a large number of unknown forces.
    </P>
    <h3>Method of Joints</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Use equilibrium of complete truss to find support reactions.</li>
        <li>Identify zero force member by inspection.</li>
        <li>Draw F.B.D. of a joint where there are at most two unknowns. Assume unknown forces in members to be
            tensile,i.e.,directed away from the point.
            Use ∑fx = 0 and ∑fy = 0 to find the two unknown forces.</li>
        <li>If the answer is positive, the force is tensile and compressive if it is negative</li>
        <li>Proceed to the next joint where there are atmost two unknowns</li>
        <li>At the last joint, verify ∑fx = 0 and ∑fy = 0 .</li>

    </ol>
    <h3>Method of Section</h3>
    <p>The method of sections involves pretending to split the truss into two or more different sections and then
        analyzing each section as a separate rigid body in equilibrium. In this method we determine the appropriate
        sections, draw free body diagrams for each section, and then write out the equilibrium equations for each
        section.
    </p>
    <h3>Method of Section</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Use equilibrium of complete truss to find support reactions.</li>
        <li>Identify zero force members by inspection.</li>
        <li>Divide the truss into two parts by passing a section through it which cuts at the most three members in
            which forces are unknown.</li>
        <li> Draw F.B.D. of any one part of the truss assuming tensile forces in members cut by the section.</li>
        <li>Use ∑fx = 0 , ∑fy = 0 and ∑M = 0 to find three unknowns.</li>

    </ol>
